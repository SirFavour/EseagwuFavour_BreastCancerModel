# EseagwuFavour_BreastCancerModel

About the Model
This is a Random Forest Classifier Model that is built to predict the occurrence of breast cancer diagnosis in Wisconsin using the breast cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) data set. This model can help diagnose breast cancer and an accuracy of 90.2% has been achieved on this model. The model uses the standard scaler on the independent variables prior to training the model. The evaluation of this model is done using the confusion matrix, accuracy score, precision score, recall score and F1- score. The results show that this model can accurately predict the occurrence of breast cancer diagnosis.
